#Who Created Albocoin ?
Albocoin was created by a group of Developers and Engineers called AlbocoinGrpup. The development started on November 2013 and was finalised on February 2014.

#How Does Albocoin Work ?
ALbocoin is an application that provides a personal Albocoin wallet and allow users to send and receive Albocoins.
Behind the scenes, the Albocoin network is sharing a public ledger called the “block chain”. This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user’s computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending Albocoins from their own Albocoin addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in Albocoins for this service. This is often called “mining”.


#Who Controls Albocoin Network ?
Albocoin Network is not owned by anyone, it is controlled by Albocoin users around the World. Albocoingroup Developers work continuously on improving the security and bug fixes. All users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules.
